      "_We can highly recommend it; not only for the valuable
      information it gives on the special subjects to which it is
      dedicated, but also for the interesting episodes of travel
      which are interwoven with, and lighten, the weightier
      matters of judicious and varied criticism on art and
      artists in northern capitals._"--ART JOURNAL.

      Scotch Story--A Man's Story. Crown 8vo. 7_s._ 6_d._

      "_Lady Barker is endowed with a rare and delicate gift
      for narrating stories,--she has the faculty of throwing
      even into her printed narrative a soft and pleasant tone,
      which goes far to make the reader think the subject or the
      matter immaterial, so long as the author will go on telling
      stories for his benefit._"--ATHENÆUM.

    STORIES ABOUT:--With Six Illustrations. Third Edition.

    Second Edition. Extra fcap. 8vo. cloth gilt. 4_s._ 6_d._

      "_We cannot too highly commend. It is exceedingly happy
      and original in the plan, and the graceful fancies of
      its pages, merry and pathetic turns, will be found
      the best reading by girls of all ages, and by boys
      too._"--TIMES.

    SYBIL'S BOOK. Illustrated by S. E. WALLER. Second Edition.
    Globe 8vo. gilt. 4_s._ 6_d._

      "_Another of Lady Barker's delightful stories, and one of
      the most thoroughly original books for girls that has been
      written for many years. Grown-up readers will like it quite
      as much as young people, and will even better understand
      the rarity of such simple, natural, and unaffected
      writing.... That no one can read the story without interest
      is not its highest praise, for no one ought to be able to
      lay it down without being the better girl or boy, or man or
      woman, for the reading of it. Lady Barker has never turned
      her fertile and fascinating pen to better account, and for
      the sake of all readers we wish 'Sybil's Book's a wide
      success._"--TIMES.

    WALLER, 8vo. cloth gilt. 10_s._ 6_d._

      "_The book is a really charming description of a thousand
      English landscapes and of the emergencies and the fun and
      the delight of a picnic journey through them by a party
      determined to enjoy themselves, and as well matched as
      the pair of horses which drew the phaeton they sat in.
      The real charm and purpose of the book is its open-air
      life among hills and dales._"--TIMES. "_The
      great charm of Mr. Black's book is that there is nothing
      hackneyed about it, nothing overdrawn,--all is bright and
      lifelike._"--MORNING POST.

    A PRINCESS OF THULE. Three vols. Sixth and cheaper Edition.
    Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      The SATURDAY REVIEW says:--"_A novel which is
      both romantic and natural, which has much feeling, without
      any touch of mawkishness, which goes deep into character
      without any suggestion of painful analysis--this is a rare
      gem to find amongst the debris of current literature,
      and this, or nearly this, Mr. Black has given us in the
      'Princess of Thule.'_" "_It has, for one thing, the great
      charm of novelty.... There is a picturesqueness in all that
      Mr. Black writes, but scarcely even in the 'Adventures
      of a Phaeton' are there the freshness and sweetness and
      perfect sense of natural beauty we find in this last
      book._"--PALL MALL GAZETTE. "_A beautiful and
      nearly perfect story._"--SPECTATOR.

    35th Thousand.

      "_Quite as rich in humorous whims of fantasy, quite as

      of Alice's former adventures._"--ILLUSTRATED LONDON
      NEWS. "_If this had been given to the world first it
      would have enjoyed a success at least equal to 'Alice in

      illuminated borders are far and away the best example of
      their art we have seen this Christmas. The pictures and
      borders are harmonious in their colouring, the dyes are
      brilliant without being raw, and the volume is a trophy of
      colour-printing. The binding by Burn is in the very best

=Culmshire Folk.=--By IGNOTUS. Three vols. Crown 8vo. 31_s._ 6_d._

      "_Its sparkling pleasantness, its drollery, its shrewdness,
      the charming little bits of character which frequently
      come in, its easy liveliness, and a certain chattiness
      which, while it is never vulgar, brings the writer very
      near, and makes one feel as if the story were being told in
      lazy confidence in an hour of idleness by a man who, while
      thoroughly good-natured, is strongly humorous, and has an
      ever-present perception of the absurdities of people and
      things._"--SPECTATOR.

      everywhere vital with moral and religious principles, and
      is written with a brightness of description, and with a

    and Vignette. Crown 8vo. 4_s._ 6_d._

      _The_ TIMES _of September 11th says it is_ "_A
      very touching story, full of promise for the after career
      of the authoress. It is so tenderly drawn, and so full of
      life and grace, that any attempt to analyse or describe it
      falls sadly short of the original. We will venture to say
      that few readers of any natural feeling or sensibility will
      take up 'Marjory' without reading it through at a sitting,
      and we hope we shall see more stories by the same hand._"
      _The_ MORNING POST _calls it_ "_A deliciously
      fresh and charming little love story._"

=Estelle Russell.=--By the Author of "The Private Life of Galileo."
    New Edition. Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      _Full of bright pictures of French life. The English
      family, whose fortunes form the main drift of the story,
      reside mostly in France, but there are also many English
      characters and scenes of great interest. It is certainly
      the work of a fresh, vigorous, and most interesting writer,
      with a dash of sarcastic humour which is refreshing and
      not too bitter._ "_We can send our readers to it with
      confidence._"--SPECTATOR.

=Evans.=--BROTHER FABIAN'S MANUSCRIPT, AND OTHER POEMS. By

    Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      "_Never, probably, has the legend of the Wandering Jew
      been more ably and poetically handled. The author writes
      as a true poet, and with the skill of a true artist.
      The plot of this remarkable drama is not only well
      contrived, but worked out with a degree of simplicity and
      truthful vigour altogether unusual in modern poetry. In
      fact, since the date of Byron's 'Cain,' we can scarcely
      recall any verse at once so terse, so powerful, and so
      masterly._"--STANDARD.

    Crown 8vo. 6_s._

      "_The stories, which are said to be literally exact,
      are more thrilling than anything in fiction. Mr.

      "_To read these brilliant details_," _says the_
      ATHENÆUM, "_is like standing on the Olympian
      threshold and gazing at the ineffable brightness within._"
      _According to the_ WESTMINSTER REVIEW, "_it
      would be difficult to point out a book that contains so
      much fulness of knowledge along with so much freshness of

      charming book, which, although in four volumes, is not a

      especially provided editions of standard works, volumes of
      selected poetry, and original compositions, which entitle
      this series to be called classical. Nothing can be better
      than the literary execution, nothing more elegant than the
      material workmanship._"--BRITISH QUARTERLY REVIEW.

    and arranged by LORD SELBOURNE. _A New and Enlarged Edition._

      "_All previous compilations of this kind must undeniably
      for the present give place to the Book of Praise.... The
      selection has been made throughout with sound judgment and
      critical taste. The pains involved in this compilation must
      have been immense, embracing, as it does, every writer of
      note in this special province of English literature, and
      ranging over the most widely divergent tracks of religious
      thought._"--SATURDAY REVIEW.

    Edited by WILLIAM ALLINGHAM.

      "_His taste as a judge of old poetry will be found, by

      and to their elders, as a useful handbook of reference, and

      a weary half-hour. We have seen no prettier gift-book for a
      long time._"--ATHENÆUM.

=The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.= Edited from the Original Edition
    by J. W. CLARK, M.A. Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

      "_Mutilated and modified editions of this English classic
      are so much the rule, that a cheap and pretty copy of it,
      rigidly exact to the original, will be a prize to many
      book-buyers._"--EXAMINER.

      Scotland, and Ireland, with the music of each prefixed to

=A Book of Golden Thoughts.= By HENRY ATTWELL, Knight of the Order
    of the Oak Crown.

      "_Mr. Attwell has produced a book of rare value....
      Happily it is small enough to be carried about in the
      pocket, and of such a companion it would be difficult to
      weary._"--PALL MALL GAZETTE.

=Guesses at Truth.= By TWO BROTHERS. New Edition.

=The Cavalier and his Lady.= Selections from the Works of the

    Compiled and arranged, with brief Notes, by MARY CARLYLE
    AITKIN. 18mo. 4_s._ 6_d._

      "_Miss Aitken's exquisite collection of Scottish Song is
      so alluring, and suggests so many topics, that we find
      it difficult to lay it down. The book is one that should
      find a place in every library, we had almost said in every
      pocket, and the summer tourist who wishes to carry with
      him into the country a volume of genuine poetry, will find
      it difficult to select one containing within so small a
      compass so much of rarest value._"--SPECTATOR.


MACMILLAN'S GLOBE LIBRARY.

      _Beautifully printed on toned paper and bound in cloth
      extra, gilt edges, price_ 4_s._ 6_d._ _each; in cloth
      plain_, 3_s._ 6_d._ _Also kept in a variety of calf and
      morocco bindings at moderate prices._

BOOKS, Wordsworth says, are

             "the spirit breathed
     By dead men to their kind;"

and the aim of the publishers of the Globe Library has been to make
it possible for the universal kin of English-speaking men to hold
communion with the loftiest "spirits of the mighty dead;" to put
within the reach of all classes _complete_ and _accurate_ editions,
carefully and clearly printed upon the best paper, in a convenient
form, at a moderate price, of the works of the MASTER-MINDS OF
ENGLISH LITERATURE, and occasionally of foreign literature in an
attractive English dress.

The Editors, by their scholarship and special study of their authors,
are competent to afford every assistance to readers of all kinds: this
assistance is rendered by original biographies, glossaries of unusual
or obsolete words, and critical and explanatory notes.

The publishers hope, therefore, that these Globe Editions may prove
worthy of acceptance by all classes wherever the English Language is
spoken, and by their universal circulation justify their distinctive
epithet; while at the same time they spread and nourish a common
sympathy with nature's most "finely touched" spirits, and thus help a
little to "make the whole world kin."

      _The_ SATURDAY REVIEW _says_: "_The Globe
      Editions are admirable for their scholarly editing, their
      typographical excellence, their compendious form, and
      their cheapness._" _The_ BRITISH QUARTERLY REVIEW
      _says_: "_In compendiousness, elegance, and scholarliness,
      the Globe Editions of Messrs. Macmillan surpass any popular
      series of our classics hitherto given to the public. As
      near an approach to miniature perfection as has ever been
      made._"

=Shakespeare's Complete Works.= Edited by W. G, CLARK, M.A., and
    W. ALDIS WRIGHT, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge, Editors
    of the "Cambridge Shakespeare." With Glossary, pp. 1,075.

      _The_ ATHENÆUM _says this edition is_ "_a marvel
      of beauty, cheapness, and compactness.... For the busy
      man, above all for the working student, this is the best
      of all existing Shakespeares._" _And the_ PALL MALL
      GAZETTE _observes_: "_To have produced the complete
      works of the world's greatest poet in such a form, and at
      a price within the reach of every one, is of itself almost
      sufficient to give the publishers a claim to be considered
      public benefactors._"

=Spenser's Complete Works.= Edited from the Original Editions and
    Manuscripts, by R. MORRIS, with a Memoir by J. W. HALES, M.A.
    With Glossary, pp. lv., 736.

      "_Worthy--and higher praise it needs not--of the beautiful
      'Globe Series.' The work is edited with all the care so
      noble a poet deserves._"--DAILY NEWS.

=Sir Walter Scott's Poetical Works.= Edited with a Biographical
    and Critical Memoir by FRANCIS TURNER PALGRAVE, and copious
    Notes, pp. xliii., 559.

      "_We can almost sympathise with a middle-aged grumbler,
      who, after reading Mr. Palgrave's memoir and introduction,
      should exclaim--'Why was there not such an edition of Scott
      when I was a school-boy?'_"--GUARDIAN.

=Complete Works of Robert Burns.=--THE POEMS, SONGS, AND LETTERS,
    edited from the best Printed and Manuscript Authorities, with
    Glossarial Index, Notes, and a Biographical Memoir by ALEXANDER
    SMITH, pp. lxii., 636.

      "_Admirable in all respects._"--SPECTATOR. "_The
      cheapest, the most perfect, and the most interesting
      edition which has ever been published._"--BELL'S
      MESSENGER.

=Robinson Crusoe.= Edited after the Original Editions, with a
    Biographical Introduction by HENRY KINGSLEY. pp. xxxi., 607.

      "_A most excellent and in every way desirable
      edition._"--COURT CIRCULAR. "_Macmillan's
      'Globe' Robinson Crusoe is a book to have and to
      keep._"--MORNING STAR.

=Goldsmith's Miscellaneous Works.= Edited, with Biographical
    Introduction, by Professor MASSON. pp. lx., 695.

      "_Such an admirable compendium of the facts of Goldsmith's
      life, and so careful and minute a delineation of the mixed
      traits of his peculiar character as to be a very model of a
      literary biography in little._"--SCOTSMAN.

=Pope's Poetical Works.= Edited, with Notes and Introductory Memoir,
    by ADOLPHUS WILLIAM WARD, M.A., Fellow of St. Peter's College,
    Cambridge, and Professor of History in Owens College, Manchester.
    pp. lii., 508.

      _The_ LITERARY CHURCHMAN _remarks_: "_The editor's
      own notes and introductory memoir are excellent, the memoir
      alone would be cheap and well worth buying at the price of
      the whole volume._"

=Dryden's Poetical Works.= Edited, with a Memoir, Revised Text,
    and Notes, by W. D. CHRISTIE, M.A., of Trinity College,
    Cambridge. pp. lxxxvii., 662.

      "_An admirable edition, the result of great research and
      of a careful revision of the text. The memoir prefixed
      contains, within less than ninety pages, as much sound
      criticism and as comprehensive a biography as the student
      of Dryden need desire._"--PALL MALL GAZETTE.

=Cowper's Poetical Works.= Edited, with Notes and Biographical
    Introduction, by WILLIAM BENHAM, Vicar of Addington and
    Professor of Modern History in Queen's College, London.
    pp. lxxiii., 536.

      "_Mr. Benham's edition of Cowper is one of permanent
      value. The biographical introduction is excellent,
      full of information, singularly neat and readable and
      modest--indeed too modest in its comments. The notes
      are concise and accurate, and the editor has been able
      to discover and introduce some hitherto unprinted
      matter. Altogether the book is a very excellent
      one._"--SATURDAY REVIEW.

=Morte d'Arthur.=--SIR THOMAS MALORY'S BOOK OF KING ARTHUR AND
    OF HIS NOBLE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE. The original Edition
    of CAXTON, revised for Modern Use. With an Introduction by Sir
    EDWARD STRACHEY, Bart. pp. xxxvii., 509.

      "_It is with perfect confidence that we recommend
      this edition of the old romance to every class of
      readers._"--PALL MALL GAZETTE.

=The Works of Virgil.= Rendered into English Prose, with
    Introductions, Notes, Running Analysis, and an Index. By JAMES
    LONSDALE, M.A., late Fellow and Tutor of Balliol College, Oxford,
    and Classical Professor in King's College, London; and SAMUEL
    LEE, M.A., Latin Lecturer at University College, London. pp. 288.

      "_A more complete edition of Virgil in English it is
      scarcely possible to conceive than the scholarly work
      before us._"--GLOBE.

=The Works Of Horace.= Rendered into English Prose, with
    Introductions, Running Analysis, Notes, and Index. By JOHN
    LONSDALE, M.A., and SAMUEL LEE, M.A.

      _The_ STANDARD _says_, "_To classical and
      non-classical readers it will be invaluable as a faithful
      interpretation of the mind and meaning of the poet,
      enriched as it is with notes and dissertations of the
      highest value in the way of criticism, illustration, and
      explanation._"
