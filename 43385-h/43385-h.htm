the most thoroughly original books for girls that has been
written for many years. Grown-up readers will like it quite
as much as young people, and will even better understand
the rarity of such simple, natural, and unaffected
writing.... That no one can read the story without interest
is not its highest praise, for no one ought to be able to
lay it down without being the better girl or boy, or man or
woman, for the reading of it. Lady Barker has never turned
her fertile and fascinating pen to better account, and for
the sake of all readers we wish 'Sybil's Book's a wide
success.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Times.</span>

<h2>MACMILLAN'S GLOBE LIBRARY.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Beautifully printed on toned paper and bound in cloth
extra, gilt edges, price</i> 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>each; in cloth
plain</i>, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <i>Also kept in a variety of calf and
morocco bindings at moderate prices.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Books</span>, Wordsworth says, are</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"the spirit breathed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By dead men to their kind;"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the aim of the publishers of the Globe Library has been to make
it possible for the universal kin of English-speaking men to hold
communion with the loftiest "spirits of the mighty dead;" to put
within the reach of all classes <i>complete</i> and <i>accurate</i> editions,
carefully and clearly printed upon the best paper, in a convenient
form, at a moderate price, of the works of the <span class="smcap">master-minds of
English Literature</span>, and occasionally of foreign literature in an
attractive English dress.</p>

<p>The Editors, by their scholarship and special study of their authors,
are competent to afford every assistance to readers of all kinds: this
assistance is rendered by original biographies, glossaries of unusual
or obsolete words, and critical and explanatory notes.</p>

<p>The publishers hope, therefore, that these Globe Editions may prove
worthy of acceptance by all classes wherever the English Language is
spoken, and by their universal circulation justify their distinctive
epithet; while at the same time they spread and nourish a common
sympathy with nature's most "finely touched" spirits, and thus help a
little to "make the whole world kin."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Saturday Review</span> <i>says</i>: "<i>The Globe

the Globe Editions of Messrs. Macmillan surpass any popular
series</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>

made.</i>"</p></div>
